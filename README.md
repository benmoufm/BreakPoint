This app is allows users to chat in group chats, or the feed part of the application. You can log in with your email or with your Facebook/Google account.

## Technologies

This application is developped in Swift 4 using Firebase to manage the authentification, database and picture storage.

## Progress

For now, the application is still in development. A first version will soon be merged to master with the basic features :
- Login with email
- Post message to feed
- Create and post messages to group chats
- User loggedin info with all the messages posted
- User can change his profile picture and description
- User search

I am trying to develop a better version of the user search to allow the user to :
- See user searched infos
- Create a chat with the searched user
- Open chat if already created
